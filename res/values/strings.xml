    <string name="intro">Violet is the colour and the world into which the humanity walks through initiation. It is the Kingdom of God, called by such names as Eden Garden, Paradise, Devachan, Su- permundane and so on. The Violet Flame relates to the 7th ray of Swaraj. Swaraj stands for self rule. Self rule demands discipleship. There are aspirants all around the globe who follow the discipline to be disciples and who endeavour to rule themselves.&lt;br /&gt; Self-rule is governed by 7th ray and 7th ray functions through Violet Flame. Violet Flame is worshiped in all the subtle Temples of 7th ray in all the four corners of the globe.&lt;br /&gt;The Violet Ray inaugurated its activity in this cycle, in the year 1675 AD. The work is subtly taking place and many are introduced to the functioning of the Violet Flame. Eso- teric temples are becoming active, transmitting their pres- ence to the seeker all around.&lt;br /&gt;333 years of work are accomplished by this year 2008. In celebration of a grand work a few invocations are given out to the ardent seeker of 7th ray activity.&lt;br /&gt; K. Parvathi Kumar, 29.01.2008</string>
